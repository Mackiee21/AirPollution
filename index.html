                    Air pollution is a type of environmental pollution that 
                    affects the air and is usually caused by smoke or other harmful gases, 
                    mainly oxides of carbon, Sulphur and nitrogen. In other words, air pollution is the 
                    contamination of air due to the presence or introduction of a substance which has a 
                    poisonous effect.

                        Air pollutants may have a natural, anthropogenic or mixed origin, depending on their sources or the sources of their precursors.
                        Key primary air pollutants include particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), sulphur 
                        oxides (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX) (including nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, 
                        NO2), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), non-methane

                            Most of the air pollution takes place due to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, gasoline to produce energy
                            for electricity or transportation. The release of carbon monoxide in high level indicates how much fossil fuel is
                            burned. This also emits other toxic pollutants in the air.

                                Industrial activities emit several pollutants in the air that
                                affects the air quality more than we can even imagine.
                                Particulate matter 2.5 and 10, Nitrogen dioxide, Sulfur
                                dioxide, and carbon monoxide are key pollutants that
                                are emitted from industries that use coal and wood as
                                their primary energy source for production of their
                                goods.

                            There is no denying that vehicle pollution is the major
                            contributor to air pollution, especially in urban cities.
                            When the car burns gasoline, it emits pollutants in the
                            air which is as harmful as smoking 10 cigarettes a day.

                            due to ignorant factors, for instance, smoking tobacco
                            inside a room or leaving mold infected wall untreated.

                            health and the environment than one may think. As per

                            health. Delhi generates a whopping 9500 tons of waste
                            every day, which makes it India’s second waste dumping

                            Agricultural activities have had a serious impact on the

                            surrounding air. Nowadays, pesticides and fertilizers are
                            mixed with new invasive species which are not found in
                            nature, for quick growth of the crops and vegetation.

                            Air pollution has a major impact on the process of plant
                            evolution by preventing photosynthesis in many cases, with
                            serious consequences for the purification of the air we breathe.
                            It also contributes to the formation of acid rain, atmospheric
                            precipitations in the form of rain, frost, snow or fog, which are
                            released during the combustion of fossil fuels and transformed
                            by contact with water steam in the atmosphere.

                            In fact, the abundance of carbon dioxide in the air is one of the
                            causes of the greenhouse effect. Normally, the presence of
                            greenhouse gases should be beneficial for the planet because
                            they absorb the infra-red radiation produced by the surface of
                            the earth. But the excessive concentration of these gases in the
                            atmosphere is the cause of the recent climate change.

                        Air pollution in India is a serious health issue. Of the 30 most polluted cities in the world, 21
                        were in India in 2019. As per a study based on 2016 data, at least 140 million people in India
                        breathe air that is 10 times or more over the WHO safe limit and 13 of the world's 20 cities
                        with the highest annual levels of air pollution are in India. 51% of the pollution is caused by
                        industrial pollution, 27 % by vehicles, 17% by crop burning and 5% by other sources. Air
                        pollution contributes to the premature deaths of 2 million Indians every year. Emissions come
                        from vehicles and industry, whereas in rural areas, much of the pollution stems from biomass
                        burning for cooking and keeping warm. In autumn and spring months, large scale crop
                        residue burning in agriculture fields – a cheaper alternative to mechanical tilling – is a major
                        source of smoke, smog and particulate pollution. India has a low per capita emissions
                        of greenhouse gases but the country as a whole is the third largest greenhouse gas producer
                        after China and the United States. A 2013 study on non-smokers has found that Indians have
                        30% weaker lung function than Europeans.
                        The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was passed in 1981 to regulate air
                        pollution but has failed to reduce pollution because of poor enforcement of the rules.
                        In 2015, Government of India, together with IIT Kanpur launched the National Air Quality
                        Index. In 2019, India launched 'The National Clean Air Programme' with tentative national
                        target of 20%-30% reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 2024, considering 2017
                        as the base year for comparison.

                    No one wants to live next door to an incinerator, oil refinery,
                    port, toxic waste dump, or other polluting site. Yet millions of
                    people around the world do, and this puts them at a much
                    higher risk for respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease,
                    neurological damage, cancer, and death.
                    Historically, racist zoning policies and the discriminatory
                    lending practices known as redlining have combined to keep
                    polluting industries and car-choked highways away from white
                    neighborhoods and have turned communities of
                    color—especially poor and working-class communities of
                    color—into sacrifice zones where residents are forced to
                    breathe dirty air and suffer the many health problems
                    associated with it. In addition to the increased health risks that

                            To control air pollution is to speed up our transition to cleaner
                            fuels and industrial processes. By switching over to renewable
                            energy sources (such as wind and solar power), maximizing
                            fuel efficiency in our vehicles, and replacing more and more of
                            our gasoline-powered cars and trucks with electric versions,
                            we'll be limiting air pollution at its source while also curbing
                            the global warming that heightens so many of its worst health
                            impacts.
                            Turn off the lights
                            when not in use
                            The energy that the lights take
                            also contribute to air pollution,
                            thus less consumption of
                            electricity can save energy.
                            Use energy saving fluorescent
                            lights to help the environment.
                            Recycle and Reuse
                            The concept of recycle and reuse is not just
                            conserve resources and use them judicially but also
                            is helpful for air pollution as it helps in reducing
                            pollution emissions. The recycled products also take
                            less power to make other products.

                                    very harmful to the environment as they
                                    take a very long time to decompose, due
                                    to their material made up of oil. The use
                                    of paper bags instead is a better
                                    alternative as they decompose easily
                                    and are recyclable

                            The air may look clear, but that doesn’t mean it’s pollution free.
                            Utilize tools like the EPA’s air pollution monitor, Air Now, to get
                            the latest conditions. If the air quality is bad, stay inside with
                            windows close.
